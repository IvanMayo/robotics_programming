### why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?
>Because they can speed the process of making the program using english libraries and most of the programs are written in high level languages

### What is machine code?
>Is the binary language used by computers and is a low level one

### Give an example of a high-level language?
>python, visual basic, visual studio

### Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages? 
>High level
1. independent of hardware 
2. complex assigment statements
3. easy lo learn and program in
>low level
4. gives complete control over the system components
5. uses less memory, it is a very efficient code
6. used more in machines for specific tasks

###  What does a translator do? 
translates the languages into machine code so the computer can understand it

### Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code? 
>**Interpreters**--`translates` the `source code` into `machine code`

>**Compilers**--`translates`  all the `source code`  at the same time to create the `compiled code`, or `machine code`

### What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler? 
interpreter--translates each code or line at a time at executes them inmediatly, you need the interpreter for the program, the more codes, the more it takes to execute

compiler--creates a copy of the code in machine form and saves it, when you want to use the program a key is asked


###  What is assembly language? 
a language that gives specific instructions to the hardware that is being programmed and finaly is translated into a single machine code

### A developer is writing a program.
 a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code? 
 >high level languages are easier to learn and program, machine code is the most basic code forms and are the instructions that computers can understand
 
  b) One type of translator is an interpreter.
        i)  **Describe**  how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code? ---it translates the main code into machine code one line at a time and executes them, this is why long codes takes longer in interpreters but this way you can identify errors at the moment they appear



   ii)  **State**  the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code? 
> PHP is another translator, it is mainly used in the web development
